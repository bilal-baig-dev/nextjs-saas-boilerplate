## Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone the repository and set it up for your own project:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the Nextjs SaaS repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bilal-baig-dev/nextjs-saas-boilerplate.git
```

Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd your-folder-name
```

### Step 3: Remove the Original Remote

To prevent pushing changes back to the original repository, you need to remove the existing remote:

```bash
git remote remove origin
```

### Step 4: Create a New Repository

1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository for your project.
2. Do not initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license.

### Step 5: Add the New Remote

After creating your new repository, add it as a remote in your cloned project:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/new-repo-name.git
```

Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username and `new-repo-name` with the name of your new repository.

### Step 6: Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 7: Start the Development Server

You can now run the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your project in action!
