_I need a Privacy Policy for my software product. The document should outline how user data is collected, used, and protected, including the following sections:_

1. **Information Collection:** Types of information collected from users, including personal and non-personal data.
2. **Use of Information:** How the collected information is used (e.g., to provide services, improve user experience, communication).
3. **Data Sharing:** Circumstances under which user information may be shared with third parties (e.g., service providers, legal requirements).
4. **Data Security:** Measures taken to protect user data from unauthorized access, breaches, or misuse.
5. **User Rights:** Users' rights regarding their personal information, including access, correction, and deletion.
6. **Cookies and Tracking Technologies:** Use of cookies or similar technologies for tracking user behavior and preferences.
7. **Changes to the Privacy Policy:** How users will be notified about changes to the Privacy Policy and the process for accepting those changes.
8. **Contact Information:** How users can contact the company for questions or concerns regarding the Privacy Policy.

_The tone should be formal and professional, ensuring transparency and compliance with applicable data protection regulations._
