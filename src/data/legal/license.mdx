# License Agreement Prompt

_I need a License Agreement for my software product. The agreement should outline the terms under which users can use the software, including the following elements:_

1. **License Grant:** The type of license (e.g., non-exclusive, non-transferable) and permitted use of the software.
2. **Restrictions:** Prohibited activities (e.g., reverse engineering, reselling, sublicensing).
3. **Intellectual Property Rights:** Clarify that all intellectual property rights remain with the licensor.
4. **Limitation of Liability:** Limit the licensorâ€™s liability in case of damages or issues arising from the software use.
5. **Termination:** Conditions under which the license can be revoked or terminated.
6. **Updates and Support:** Any provisions related to software updates, patches, or support services.
7. **Governing Law:** The jurisdiction under which the agreement will be governed.

_The tone should be formal and professional. Make it applicable to both individual users and businesses._
