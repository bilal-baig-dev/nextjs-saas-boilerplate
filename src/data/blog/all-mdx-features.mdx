## Introduction

Welcome to our comprehensive guide on MDX features! MDX is a powerful format that combines Markdown with JSX, allowing you to use React components in your content. Let's explore the key features and capabilities of MDX.

SaaSpack empowers you to write your content for blogs through the magic of <ExternalLink href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</ExternalLink> and <ExternalLink href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</ExternalLink>. This guide equips you with everything you need to get started!

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Markdown `(.md)` and MDX `(.mdx)` are popular file formats for writing blog content, combining the simplicity of plain text with powerful formatting capabilities. Markdown's lightweight syntax allows writers to focus on their content while easily adding structure and styling. MDX extends this functionality by enabling the use of JSX and React components within Markdown documents.

## Nested Routes

SaasPack supports creating nested routes allows you to organize your content in a hierarchical structure. This can be especially useful for blogs that benefits from a nested structure.

For example, if you create a file at `/data/blog/nested-route/my-post.mdx`, the post will be available at `/my-post`.

### MDX with Next.js

MDX is a superset of markdown that lets you write JSX directly in your markdown files. MDX is a special way to write content for websites and blogs. It lets you write content in a simple text format and automatically converts it into structured HTML code. It is a powerful way to add dynamic interactivity and embed React components within your content.

You can optionally provide `remark` and `rehype` plugins to transform the MDX content.

For example, you can use `remark-gfm` to support <ExternalLink href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">GitHub Flavored Markdown.</ExternalLink>

Since the remark and rehype ecosystem is ESM only, you'll need to use next.config.mjs as the configuration file to setup as given below:

<CodeBlock>

{
`

// next.config.mjs

import remarkGfm from "remark-gfm";
import createMDX from "@next/mdx";

const nextConfig = {
pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
// Optionally, add any other Next.js config below
}

const withMDX = createMDX({
// Add markdown plugins here, as desired
options: {
remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
rehypePlugins: [],
},
})

// Wrap MDX and Next.js config with each other
export default withMDX(nextConfig)
`}

</CodeBlock>

### Adding an Article

Adding a new article to your SaaSpack-powered blog is as simple as creating a new Markdown `.mdx file` file within the `src/data/blog` directory. The filename automatically becomes the article's slug.

#### Frontmatter

After creating the article, set the Frontmatter which is used to fill in the article's metadata, such as title, summary, or images. Basic example of Frontmatter fields are given below:

<CodeBlock>
 {`
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2024-07-27T15:30:00+02:00
description: "A brief description of your post"
summary: "A concise summary of your post"
draft: false
---

`}

</CodeBlock>

There are number of additional fields you can include. Here's a comprehensive list of all the fields that can be used in the frontmatter, adhering to <ExternalLink href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">Hugo's standards</ExternalLink>.

### Syntax guide

Hereâ€™s a summary of Markdown syntax that you can use in `.md` or `.mdx` files
In Markdown, headings are created using the # symbol. The number of # symbols determines the level of the heading, with # representing the highest level (h1) and ###### representing the lowest level (h6).

#### Headings

<CodeBlock>
{`
# This is an H1 heading

## This is an H2 heading

### This is an H3 heading

#### This is an H4 heading

##### This is an H5 heading

###### This is an H6 heading

`}

</CodeBlock>

#### Unordered Lists

Unordered lists in Markdown use `\*, +, or -` for bullet points. Each item starts on a new line.

<CodeBlock>
  {`
  
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2

`}

</CodeBlock>

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2

#### Ordered Lists

Ordered lists in Markdown use numbers followed by periods. Markdown automatically numbers the items correctly.

<CodeBlock>
  {`
  
1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem 2.1
   2. Subitem 2.2

`}

</CodeBlock>

1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem 2.1
   2. Subitem 2.2

#### Emphasis

Emphasis in Markdown is used to highlight text by making it italic or bold.

<CodeBlock>
  {`
_This is an example of  Ittalic text_
**I am bold text**
**_Example of Bold and italic text_**
`}
</CodeBlock>

_This is an example of Ittalic text_

**I am bold text**

**_Example of Bold and italic text_**

#### Blockquotes

Blockquotes in Markdown are used to highlight quoted text.

    - Syntax: Start a line with the `> symbol`, followed by a space.

<CodeBlock>

{
`

> **Note:** Remember to backup your files regularly.

`}

</CodeBlock>

> **Note:** Remember to backup your files regularly.

#### Horizontal Rules

Horizontal lines (or horizontal rules) in Markdown are used to create a thematic break or separate sections of content.

    - Syntax: Use three or more hyphens `(---)`, asterisks `(***)`, or underscores `(___)` on a new line.

<CodeBlock>

{
`

---

`}

</CodeBlock>

---

#### Links

Links in Markdown allow you to create clickable text that navigates to another URL.

    - `Syntax: [link text](URL)`

<CodeBlock>

{
`
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)

`}

</CodeBlock>

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)

#### Images

Images in Markdown allow you to display pictures.

    - Syntax: `![alt text](URL)`

<CodeBlock>

{
`
![GitHub Logo](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png)

`}

</CodeBlock>

![GitHub Logo](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png)

#### Code Blocks and Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks in Markdown are used to display code snippets with or without syntax highlighting.

    - Code Block (Fenced): Use triple backticks `(```)` before and after the code block. Optionally, specify the language for syntax highlighting.

<CodeBlock>
{
`
\`\`\`

function greet(name) {

    return \`Hello, \${name}!\`;

}

console.log(greet('MDX User'));

\`\`\`
`}

</CodeBlock>

```
function greet(name) {

  return \`Hello, \${name}!\`;

}

console.log(greet('MDX User'));

```

Syntax highlighting enhances the readability of code by displaying it in different colors and styles according to the language. This is achieved by specifying the language after the opening triple backticks like ` ```javascript `

#### Inline Code

<CodeBlock>
{`
To install the package, run \`npm install @next/mdx\`.

`}

</CodeBlock>

To install the package, run `npm install @next/mdx`.

#### Tables

Tables in Markdown are used to display tabular data.

    - Syntax: Use pipes `(|)` to separate columns and hyphens `(-)` to create the header row. Colons `(:)` can be used to align columns.

To enhance Markdown tables and other syntaxes, you can use the remark-gfm plugin. It supports <ExternalLink href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/">GitHub Flavored Markdown</ExternalLink>, which includes tables, task lists, and strikethroughs.

<CodeBlock>
{
`
| Feature     | Description             |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Markdown    | Write content easily    |
| JSX         | Use React components    |
| Flexibility | Combine both seamlessly |

`}

</CodeBlock>

| Feature     | Description             |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Markdown    | Write content easily    |
| JSX         | Use React components    |
| Flexibility | Combine both seamlessly |

#### Task Lists

Task lists in Markdown are used to create checklists or to-do lists. They can be particularly useful for project management, documentation, and organizing tasks.

- Syntax: Use `- [ ]` for an unchecked item and `- [x]` for a checked item.

<CodeBlock>
{
`
- [ ] Task 1
- [x] Task 2 (completed)
- [ ] Task 3
`
}

</CodeBlock>

- [ ] Task 1
- [x] Task 2 (completed)
- [ ] Task 3

#### Strikethrough

Strikethrough in Markdown is used to indicate deleted or obsolete text.

    - Syntax: Wrap the text in double tildes `(~~)`.

<CodeBlock>
{
`
~~This text is struck through.~~
`
}

</CodeBlock>

~~This text is struck through.~~

#### React Components in MDX

MDX allows you to embed React components directly within your Markdown content. This provides a powerful way to create interactive and dynamic content.

**Using MDXRemote in Next.js**

As we are using `next.js`, so will be using `next-mdx-remote` which is a library that allows you to load MDX content from any source and use it in your Next.js application. This is especially useful for dynamic content fetched from a CMS or API.

Steps to Use MDXRemote with React Components

1. Install necessary packages:

<CodeBlock>
  {`
  npm install next-mdx-remote remark remark-html remark-gfm
`}
</CodeBlock>

2. Create React components:

<CodeBlock>

{`
// components/Alert.js
const Alert = ({ message }) => {
return (

<div style={{ padding: "10px", background: "yellow", border: "1px solid gold" }}>{message}</div>
); };

export default Alert;
`}
</CodeBlock>

3. Fetch and render MDX content:

<CodeBlock>
{
`
// pages/blog/[slug].js
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote';
import { MDXRemoteSerializeResult, serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize';
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm';
import Alert from '../../components/Alert';

export default function BlogPost({ mdxSource }) {
  const components = {
    Alert,
    // Add more custom components here
  };

return (

<div>
  <MDXRemote {...mdxSource} components={components} />
</div>
); }

//fetch blog using the slug
async function getBlogPost(slug: string) {
const post = getFileBySlug({ slug });
const { content, data } = matter(post);
const mdxSource = await serialize(content, {
scope: data,
mdxOptions: {
remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
},
});
return { source: mdxSource, frontMatter: data };
}

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const allBlogData = getSortedPostsData();
  return allBlogData.map((blog) => ({
    slug: blog.slug,
  }));
}

`
}

</CodeBlock>

Some more examples of embeding React components directly within Markdown content, enabling dynamic and reusable elements.

<CodeBlock>

{`

<CallOut type="info">This is an info callout component!</CallOut>
<CallOut type="warning">This is a warning callout component!</CallOut>
<CallOut type="error">This is a error callout component!</CallOut>
`}
</CodeBlock>

<CallOut type="info">This is an info callout component!</CallOut>

<CallOut type="warning">This is a warning callout component!</CallOut>

<CallOut type="error">This is a error callout component!</CallOut>

#### JSX in Markdown

You can use JSX directly in your Markdown:

<CodeBlock>
  {`
{5 + 5 === 10 && <p>5 + 5 equals 10</p>}
`}
</CodeBlock>

{5 + 5 === 10 && <p>5 + 5 equals 10</p>}

#### Conclusion

MDX offers a flexible and powerful way to create rich, interactive content by combining the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. This guide demonstrates many of MDX's key features, but there's always more to explore. Happy MDX-ing!
